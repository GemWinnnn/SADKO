Flutter supports both Android and iOS and the app is planned to be deployed on both platforms.

### Content Management

[Strapi](https://strapi.io/) is used for the app contents like history and images. Please head over to our custom [content management system](http://128.199.253.64:1337/) to edit the data.	



### The App Icon

The app icon is a monogram of characters "W" and "V" for West Visayas. The "W" is curved like a road and "V" serves as a marker pin.
